Here, it is provided an example of the data that were used to run the selection methods after transforming the snp and the haplotype data to the correct format.

We have 2 kind of files:
- SNP file (snp0.txt, snpIhs.txt). Different formats were needed for the different selection methods
- haplotype files for all the subpopulations and for all the allele frequencies of the selected locus.
  Example: w01.phase contains the haplotypes of the w subpopulation when the allele frequency of the selected locus was close to 0.1.
